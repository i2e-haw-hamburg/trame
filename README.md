TRAME - TRAck ME (if you can)
=============================

Skeleton tracking abstraction library.

## Build

```BASH
# create a directory for the build, eg. 'build'
mkdir build
cd build
# call cmake
cmake ..
# call make
make
```

## Tests

In the test folder are a performance test and a skeleton viewer. The skeleton viewer is implemented in Python with pyprocessing. So you need to install this first, before you can use the viewer.
